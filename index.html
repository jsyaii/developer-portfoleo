            <h1><span class="SPIDER">SPIDER</span>MAN</h1>
            <p>Spider-Man, comic-book character who was the original everyman superhero. In Spider-Man’s first story, in
                Marvel Comics’ Amazing Fantasy, no. 15 (1962), American teenager Peter Parker, a poor sickly orphan, is
                bitten by a radioactive spider. As a result of the bite, he gains superhuman strength, speed, and
                agility along with the ability to cling to walls. Writer Stan Lee and illustrator Steve Ditko created
                Spider-Man as a filler story for a canceled anthology series. At the time, a teenage lead hero was
                unheard of in comic books. However, young readers responded powerfully to Peter Parker, prompting an
                ongoing title and, ultimately, a media empire, including video games, several animated and one
                live-action television series, a live-action film franchise, and a Broadway musical.</p>
